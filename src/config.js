`This is a tribute to the desktop pattern editor in early Mac systems (like System 6). That editor let you create an 8x8 pixel, black-and-white pattern and use it as your desktop background.

Click inside the left box to make pixels black or white.

Preview your pattern in the right box. Click the preview to set the background for the whole page. Click the arrows above the preview to cycle through built-in patterns.

"Link to pattern" is a permanent link to your pattern. Share the link to show your pattern to others.

Below you'll see a single tile of your pattern at several different sizes. Save your pattern locally by right-clicking and selecting "Save image as...".`;
