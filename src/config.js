`This is a tribute to and imitation of the desktop pattern editor in early Macintosh systems (like System 6). That editor let you create an 8x8 pixel, black-and-white pattern and use it as your desktop background.

Above you'll see two boxes side-by-side.

Click inside the left box to make pixels black or white.

Preview your pattern in the right box. Click the preview to set the background for the whole page. Click the arrows above the preview to cycle through built-in patterns.

"Link to pattern" is a permanent link to your pattern. Share the link to show your pattern to others.

Below that you'll see a single tile of your pattern at several different sizes. Save your pattern locally by right-clicking one of them and selecting "Save image as...". Make the saved image your desktop background for a fuller retro-Mac experience.

Finally, you can press the "L" key to "play" a variation on Conway's Game of Life. That's not an option in the Mac pattern editor - just added for fun here.
